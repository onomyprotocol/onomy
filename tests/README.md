This uses a [super_orchestrator](https://github.com/AaronKutch/super_orchestrator) based test harness system with some middle level functionality supplied by [onomy_tests](https://github.com/pendulum-labs/onomy_tests). All tests should be run from the repository root (not from the ./test directory or anywhere else) by `cargo r --bin [test binary name]`. Run `cargo doc --open` to find developer functions. Dockerfiles used by the tests are in `tests/dockerfiles`, and various resources are located in `tests/logs`, `tests/resources`, and `tests/dockerfiles/dockerfile_resources`.

If a set of running containers stalls or you need to terminate them quickly, you do not want to Ctrl-C the main runner which will leave containers running in the background, instead run `cargo r --bin auto_exec_i -- --container-name [name of a container]` from a different terminal and it will find the container. You can Ctrl-C to terminate the container (and usually will terminate the rest if super_orchestrator was used correctly), and can Ctrl-C again to terminate auto_exec_i (or you can leave it to wait for another run of the container).
