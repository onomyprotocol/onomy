# Onomy Testnet

At [Onomy Protocol](https://onomy.io/), we are excited to launch our public testnet for the Onomy Network (ONET)
blockchain.

As a Cosmos Tendermint-based chain, the ONET works via a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, where the bNOM and it's 10^18 NOM representation is bonded to
validators either directly or through delegation. The ONET will power the Onomy Exchange (hybrid DEX) and Onomy
Reserve (stablecoin issuance), whilst operating with 100x the efficiency of Ethereum and facilitating inter-chain asset
trading of NOM, Onomy's stablecoins, and other crypto assets.

This iteration is also focused on proving out the Gravity bridge as well as deployment methodology and other custom
modules for the upcoming production Onomy incentivized testnet and mainnet.

The documentation here will guide you through the steps needed to run full nodes, obtain bNOM/NOM, and
try out the Onomy Network.

To join us or discuss the current testnet, kindly get in touch with us via [Discord](https://discord.gg/27r73SYAkQ)
