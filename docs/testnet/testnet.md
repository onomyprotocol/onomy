# Onomy Testnet

At [Onomy Protocol](https://onomy.io/), we are excited to launch our first public testnet for the Onomy Network (ONET) blockchain. 

As a Cosmos Tendermint-based chain, the ONET works via a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, where NOM is bonded to validators either directly or through delegation. The ONET will power the Onomy Exchange (hybrid DEX) and Onomy Reserve (stablecoin issuance), whilst operating with 100x the efficiency of Ethereum and facilitating inter-chain asset trading of NOM, Onomy's stablecoins, and other crypto assets.

This iteration is also focused on proving out the Gravity bridge as well as deployment methodology and other custom modules for the upcoming production Onomy incentivized testnet and mainnet.

The documentation here will guide you through the steps needed to run full nodes, become a validator, obtain NOM from the testnet faucet, and try out the Onomy Network. 

To join us as a mainnet validator or discuss the current testnet, kindly get in touch with us via [Discord](https://discord.gg/ge7Rt9hdpa). More focused discussions are possible on our [official forum](https://forum.onomy.io/). 

If you are looking to integrate against the Onomy testnet you can use the public rpc
