# How to Run an Onomy Testnet Full Node

As a Cosmos-based chain, the ONET full nodes are similar to any Cosmos full nodes. Unlike the validator flow, running a full node requires no external software. 

## Getting Started?
Minimum system requirements:
- A Linux server with any modern Linux distribution, 
- A quad-core CPU
- 8 GiB of RAM
- 20gb of storage.

Make sure you have gone through [Pre installation Steps](pre-installation.md) prior to setting up a node.

There are two ways for setting up the node, one is the standard method where everything is done by running a pre-configured script while second one is for more advanced users who might want to customize their installation:
1. [Standard Method](#standardMethod)
2. [Advanced Method](#advancedMethod)

## <a name="standardMethod"> 1. Standard Method
### Initiate chain

Clone the latest release of github repo
```
git clone -b v0.0.1 https://github.com/onomyprotocol/onomy.git
cd onomy/deploy/testnet
```

### Run the first time bootstrapping playbook and script

This script will run the needed commands to generate keys and store those in files. Be mindful of the generated keys, as youâ€™ll need them later.


```
bash peer-validator/init-full-node.sh
```
Script will ask you a few questions for parameters:
1. Node name (Enter any name for your node)
2. Node id of any validator that is running in chain to add seed (Please enter `5e0f5b9d54d3e038623ddb77c0b91b559ff13495`)
3. IP address or Host Name of validator for which you have added node-id (Please enter `testnet1.onomy.io`)

Note:- Here the default home directory path is `~/.onomy` or `$HOME/.onomy`, if you have changed it then you need add `--home` flag to `onomyd` command whenever you use it. If you are using the default path then its optional.

```
onomyd --home /path/to/your/onomy/home ......
```

Now, your node is finally up and has started the syncing with blockchain

### Check the status of the Onomy Network Testnet

You should be good to go! You can check the status of the Onomy chain by running:
```
curl http://localhost:26657/status
```
If catching_up is false, this means that your node is fully synced. Congratulations!

### Init the config files

```
cd $HOME
onomyd --home $HOME/.onomy init {validator moniker} --chain-id onomy-testnet1
```
Here, validator moniker is a an arbitrary name for your validator

Note:- The default home directory path is `~/.onomy` or `$HOME/.onomy`, if you have to changed it then you need add `--home` flag to `onomyd` command as shown above. If you are using the default path then its optional.

We will refer to onomy home directory as $ONOMY_HOME for here on.

### Copy the genesis file
You need to get the latest genesis file from testnet and replace it with the one in your $ONOMY_HOME directory
```
rm $HOME/.onomy/config/genesis.json
wget http://testnet1.onomy.io:26657/genesis? -O $HOME/raw.json
jq .result.genesis $HOME/raw.json >> $HOME/.onomy/config/genesis.json
rm -rf $HOME/raw.json
```

### Update toml configuration files

1. Make following changes in $ONOMY_HOME/config/config.toml:

	- add *5e0f5b9d54d3e038623ddb77c0b91b559ff13495@testnet1.onomy.io:26656* to seeds field. It should look somthing like this
	`seeds = "5e0f5b9d54d3e038623ddb77c0b91b559ff13495@testnet1.onomy.io:26656"`

	- add *tcp://0.0.0.0:26656* to external_address field `external_address = "tcp://0.0.0.0:26656"`

	- change laddr under \[rpc\] section from "tcp://127.0.0.1:26657" to "tcp://0.0.0.0:26657"
	- change addr_book_strict = true to addr_book_strict = false

2. Make following changes in $ONOMY_HOME/config/app.toml:

	- Under api section, change enable = false to enable = true
	- Under api section, change swagger = false to swagger = true

## Increasing the default open files limit
If we don't raise this value nodes will crash once the network grows large enough
```
sudo su -c "echo 'fs.file-max = 65536' >> /etc/sysctl.conf"
sysctl -p

sudo su -c "echo '* hard nofile 94000' >> /etc/security/limits.conf"
sudo su -c "echo '* soft nofile 94000' >> /etc/security/limits.conf"

sudo su -c "echo 'session required pam_limits.so' >> /etc/pam.d/common-session"
```
After making these changes, you will either need to reboot your system or close all the ssh sessions and connect again.

To check if changes took place, run 
```
ulimit -n
```
If limit is still 1024, changes are not in effect yet.

### Start your full node in another terminal and wait for it to sync

```
onomyd --home $ONOMY_HOME start
```

### Check the status of the Onomy chain

You should be good to go! You can check the status of the Onomy chain by running.
```
curl http://localhost:26657/status
```
if catching_up is false means your node is fully synced
