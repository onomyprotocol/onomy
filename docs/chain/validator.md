# Validator on the Onomy Network

Validators should not be allowed to join set with a sufficient enough stake. Network manager to supply
NOM to those stakeholders wishing to run the validator. This option is for stakeholders only with 250k+ NOM.
Anyone may run a node, but only stakeholders may participate in validating the network.
